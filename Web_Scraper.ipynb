The Sindh Government offers scholarships to students of Karachi campus on need-cum-merit for both under-graduate and graduate studies. The scholarship covers full tuition fee for entire duration of the program, renewable every year.

Financial assistance is limited to tuition fee only and is discontinued if the student’s CGPA falls below the minimum specified to avoid warning. Loan recipients MUST take full load of courses offered.  Applicants desirous of seeking study loan should apply for this purpose on the prescribed form available from all campuses or downloadable from the University web site. The repayment of loan starts three months after graduation or soon after getting employment, whichever is earlier. The total amount has to be repaid within a period of four years after graduation.

            "                 The Software Quality Engineering and Testing Center (QUEST) focuses on engineering of reliable and dependable software systems. Quality Engineering and Testing of software systems is an active research area and is receiving a lot of attention worldwide. However, catastrophic software failures are still reported frequently. There is an ever-increasing need to develop better quality software by using systematic engineering techniques. For this purpose, the center will investigate the use of model-driven approaches for developing high quality software. Almost all professionals in software industry agree on the need to thoroughly test the developed software. However, the actual testing process is severely hindered by lack of automation. Software testing is a time consuming process that requires specific expertise and automation to be cost-effective, which are often not available in industry. The QUEST center aims to bridge this gap by developing novel strategies and tools for quality engineering and automated testing that are scalable in industrial context. The real impact of software engineering is visible only when the practices/techniques are transferred to the practitioners/industry. Therefore, the center focuses on performing applied research by solving real industrial problems. For this purpose we work closely with local and international industrial and research partners.  The key research and academic goals of the lab include: International Collaborations Engineering dependable and reliable systems is a difficult challenge, which requires cross-disciplinary collaboration involving both the academia and the industry. The Quest lab is actively involved in research collaborations with researchers from renowned research organizations such as Simula Labs, Norway and the Inter-disciplinary Center for Security and Trust (SnT).  Current Projects QUEST Lab Home Page Impact Factor International Journal publications from QUEST in 2013/2014 The evolution and maturity of parallel, distributed and Cloud computing in last few decades has opened up new horizons in research and applications in these domains. The objective of SEcure Networks and Distributed Systems (SENDS) research group at NUCES is to explore and provide innovative and secure solutions in the rich field of distributed computing. SENDS team focuses on investigation, design and development of scalable and efficient systems and algorithms for the delivery of services to the end user in a distributed environment over the Internet or via a private network. SENDS research group is working in various related domains such as Cloud, Edge and Fog Computing, Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing, Internet of Things, Information Security and Privacy, Green Computing, Computer Networks (Performance Modeling, Admission and Congestion Control, Quality of Service, Mobility Management and its Cost Analysis, P2P systems, Routing Protocols, Fault Management), Software Defined Networking, Business Processes and Services Oriented Architectures and Middleware Systems. For more information, visit SENDS Lab Homepage. The objectives of this centre are to carry out research and development in software engineering and allied application areas. The centre promotes theoretical research in the software engineering area, resolve problems faced by the software industry, and helps establish software engineering practices in the industry. Through SERC, the University seeks to help and support the local software industry in establishing and improving their processes and practices through continuous feedback and training. SERC aims to achieve these objectives by collecting the industry data to understand productivity, cost, and quality parameters. This will hopefully also help in developing more suitable process and lifecycle models for different types of projects being undertaken by our local industry in the offshore and distributed environment. Software Architecture, Software Project Management, Software Quality and Process Improvement are main areas of research. Sample Projects Completed On-going Projects ReVeaL is a research group that focuses on applied research in Visual Recognition, Computer Vision and Machine Learning for solving real-world large-scale complex problems. In ReVeaL the goal is to conceive, design and develop recognition systems that can recognize and understand the content of an image (or video) and then make informed decisions or recommendations. Building such systems not only demands solutions for complex recognition and inference problems but also requires answers to challenging computational questions. Research areas include: Members of the group: Following faculty members are part of this group: The primary motivation for the creation of this group is to encourage the development and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in our students and faculty members. It promotes inter-disciplinary exchanges between AI and other fields such as information processing, energy management etc. Its principal focus is to maintain a sustainable research base aimed for graduate and post-graduate students within relevant research areas.  This research group emphasizes on the areas of Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Mining. We explore the applications of the algorithms and techniques from these areas, in real life scenarios. The group has ongoing research work that investigates the creation of automated and independent learning within machines. Some areas where our research work is applied include Game AI, Social Computing, Knowledge Management, as well as other classical areas of research such as function optimization in dynamic or time variant environments.  Members of the group: Electrical Engineering Department hosts the Embedded Systems & Pervasive Computing (EPIC) Lab that as the name suggests, encompasses research and development activities in the broad areas of Embedded Systems, Internet of Things (IOT), Cloud Computing and integration of software and hardware systems. It is headed by Dr. Ataul Aziz Ikram, Associate Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering. Currently, a Higher Education Commission (HEC) funded National Research Program for Universities (NRPU) project is being executed by Dr. Ataul Aziz Ikram, Principal Investigator. The title of the project is “Implementation of a multi-device multi technology cloud, performance evaluation and customization for commercial applications”. The project is in collaboration with the University of Gujrat, Hafiz Hayat Campus, and the Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Zia- Ul Qayyum, who is also the Vice Chancellor there. To bridge the gap between academia and industry, the University has joined hands with Huawei Technologies to establish a training center at its Islamabad campus. It is now a “Huawei Authorized Learning Partner (HALP)” and is able to deliver Huawei Certified Network Associate training program. The three programs currently offered include HCNA Unified Communications and HCNA Storage and HCNA Routers and Switches. Six batches that constituted Industry Professionals and University Alumni have successfully completed HCNA training from HALP. Huawei Authorized Information and Network Academy (HAINA) is a not-for-profit partnership program that authorizes universities and colleges to deliver Huawei Certification courses to their students. Huawei and Islamabad campus signed HAINA agreement recently and two batches have already completed their Training Program. The University believes that practical knowledge will create opportunities and will support effective and sustainable growth. Through the HAINA program, Huawei and NUCES contributes support to the local ICT education, shares knowledge, creates more opportunities, and builds a better ICT talent eco-system.

            "         Centre for Information Visualization and Intelligent Computing (CIVIC) has been established at the Lahore campus with the aim of conducting research in various areas of Intelligent Computing, Knowledge Engineering, Image Processing and Computer Graphics.  Many groups are actively participating in research and development under the umbrella of CIVIC.  A brief introduction to these groups and their related research activities is given below:  The group is exploring various theoretical and practical aspects of geometric modeling approaches to path planning algorithms. In addition to path planning they are also working actively in the area of reverse engineering where it is required to capture 2D objects, outline of planar images, or generation of 3D geometric models of existing objects for which no such models exist. This research group is exploring state of the art techniques for storing, retrieving and analyzing data for developing business intelligence tools and systems. It is also working in the area of Intelligent Information Retrieval and Text Mining from databases. The focus of research of this group is in the area of developing and designing intelligent user interfaces according to Cognitive Systems Engineering, Cognitive Psychology and behavioral aspects of different users. This group is actively developing different applications using latest techniques in Image Processing and Machine Vision. Recently, members of this group have gained nationwide recognition by winning various prizes in the software and programming competition at NaSCon. The machine learning group is exploring various theoretical techniques in supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. This research group is working in collaboration with top researchers from the Electrical Engineering Department of University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. Projects Following is a list of the current research projects undertaken by CIVIC: This lab is developing innovate techniques for efficient communication of voice, video and data, especially in the internet connected world. Limited bandwidth of transmission medium (wire-line and wireless) and user’s demand for good quality of service pose interesting challenges for the researchers. Specific areas of work in Computer Networks include providing QoS in the WLANs for real-time multimedia communication, Statistical modelling of the MAC layer for delay and throughput analysis, cross-layer design for improving performance over wireless networks, and joint source-channel encoding for image and video.  In wireless communication, the research focuses on exploiting MIMO technology in order to develop algorithms to achieve higher data rates at low errors. This includes analysing system performance under various channel conditions and designing coding schemes to mitigate the effects of channel impairment. One of the projects, entitled, “Dynamic Scheduling and Call Admission Control for Quality of Service (QoS) Provision in Real-time Multimedia Application over IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)” was funded by the PTCL R&D Fund for Thematic Research Grant. The goal of this research was to develop novel scheduling and call admission control (CAC) mechanisms for IEEE 802.11e WLANs. Outcome of this research was development of a novel scheduler, named Proportional Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (PIMD), and a measurement based CAC algorithms. Both algorithms have been published in the proceedings of International refereed conferences. As an extension to this project, modelling and delay analysis of real time multimedia streams (voice and video) over WLAN is being done with an aim to achieve optimal admission control that adapts to dynamic network conditions. Mathematical analysis of PIMD for its suability in various network configurations is being investigated. In MIMO wireless communication systems, analytical modelling under various fading channels and employing hybrid system (BLAST vs. STBC) are current areas of research. Work is also being done on enhancing combating capabilities of system against variations and inherent interference present in fading.  The MIMO systems are being analysed by including pre-coder and multi-user detection. The future direction of the research is towards developing communication and network algorithms for implementation for the upcoming 4G –LTE and mobile wi-max systems. CRMG is established by the FAST School of Management, Lahore Campus (“FSM”) to motivate research on the impact of management and governance philosophies on the art and practice of these disciplines. The centre is jointly run by Dr Hamid Hassan, Dr Zia Khan and Dr Akbar Azam. Dr Hamid Hassan was Visiting Research Fellow at the Institute of International Affairs, Aichi University, Nagoya campus, Aichi, Japan working in coordination with Prof. Yasuo Hoshino of Aichi University, on “Role of Leadership in the Organizational Success”. PhD students enrolled at FSM are conducting research on related themes. Bimonthly seminars facilitate sharing of ideas and updates. The findings from the theoretical and empirical research conducted at CRMG are expected to provide guidelines to deal with the governance issues of public and private sector organizations and help eliminate the redundant activities that cause wastage of resources at micro and macro level in the firm and the economy. Some of the recent results of research endeavors at CRMG are as following. Visit: www.serc.org.pk Software Research Engineering Centre is dedicated to conducting research and development in various facets of software engineering. The centre has been established to promote theoretical research in the software engineering area, resolve problems faced by the software industry, and help establish software engineering practices in the industry. Through the establishment of the SERC, the University seeks to help and support the local software industry in establishing and improving their processes and practices through continuous feedback and training. SERC aims to achieve these objectives by collecting the industry data to understand productivity, cost, and quality parameters. This will hopefully also help in developing more suitable process and lifecycle models for different types of projects being undertaken by our local industry in the offshore and distributed environment. During the last few years, this Centre has arranged many seminars and workshops in the software engineering domain. Sample Past Projects Recent Publications E-Learning Project Tool for Improvement of Cohesiveness in Emotive Writing, funded by ICT R &D. Liberty Lab is established to engineer multi-disciplinary solutions for socially grounded problems and to achieve advancement in Robotics. Research is done to make robots that can achieve autonomous behavior. Problems of localization, mapping, navigation and image processing in robots are explored. Control algorithms on ground and air robots are developed to improve the navigation capabilities of such robots. The goal is to make autonomous mobile and industrial robots, and induce learning and long-term autonomy in them. Using the output of this research, solutions to industrial and societal problems using robotics and embedded systems technology are devised. The lab aims to construct low cost robots that are intelligent enough to work around in industry, farms and houses. A lot of algorithms have been devised in literature with promising results, but still we don’t see these algorithms deployed on robots around us. The research group thus wants to make robots for very simple tasks which can be performed by robots. Similarly, there are scenarios that only require an embedded solution, as opposed to standard articulated robot. The research group aims to devise such embedded systems. The lab has expanded its operation in three broad thematic areas namely, systems, humans and crops. The lab aims to put together and apply the knowledge gained from diverse areas of expertise including robotics, embedded systems and artificial intelligence, to engineer out-of-the-box solutions that practically solve the problems faced by the local society. The lab achieves its aims via workshops, talks and projects at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Collaborators and Research Partners The lab initiated multiple projects in collaboration with leading medical institutes of the country, including, King Edward Medical University and Services Institute of Medical Sciences (Services Hospital). These projects include an EMG controlled prosthetic arm, retinopathy classification for diabetics, bio-thesiometer for neuropathy, contact-less waist measurement for patients and bone recovery analyzer. The research group has acquired a grant from the German government in collaboration with University of Kaiserslautern, for a medium term project to start automation of agriculture in Pakistan using robots. Students and faculty members from both participating universities will visit and work with their partner university for a couple of months each year. The grant will be utilized for R&D in automatic detection of weed in wheat crops using flying robots. The research group organized the 7th International Workshop on Field and Assistive Robots (WFAR-7) on 17-18 Oct 2014, which showcased talks from researchers, robot demos and poster session with robotics students. It brought together the robotics community in Pakistan and Europe. This year, the group plans to organize the 9th International event on Field and Assistive Robots in October 2015. Current Projects The lab currently consists of three faculty members, five research assistants, nine graduate students and about 50 undergrad students. Projects currently underway are disaster management using robotics, collaborative tasks using teams of robots, aid of shoppers, etc. The lab is also running multiple projects on traffic congestion detection and control using different sensing mechanisms including mobile phone accelerometers, cameras, flying robots and crowd sourcing. In the field of agriculture, the lab runs projects to monitor weed, pests and irrigation of crops. FAST-House Rohtas Road, G-9/4 Islamabad - 44000\n",

Think about what you can do to improve your future\" these words might seem boring but trust me they really kept me going.\r\n",
            "Somewhere in between my university term, I started to repent my decision about studying engineering. My family was business-oriented so my interest started developing towards it. I graduated in 2020 as an Electrical Engineer and started working for a solar company as an intern but my interest and passion towards business remained and this motivated me to take the leap from engineering to business and I applied for banking positions because what better way to learn business than through banking. And Alhumdullilah I got selected and I'm currently working for SilkBank Islamic Branch. Studying Engineering doesn't mean you're bound to work in the engineering field only. There are endless opportunities for young graduates. This thinking is what led to where I am right now and this is just a start. I urge you all to keep working hard and have faith. Look out for all the opportunities and with all the skills you can get hired in no time. \"\r\n",

For almost all courses, the semester work will contribute 50% towards the final grade, while the final examination will contribute the remaining 50% of the total marks. A letter grade will be awarded to each student based on his/her overall academic performance in a course. The Grade Point Average calculation ensures a continuous scale for the respective grades. The grade issued by the University will be final. Two types of averages will be computed for the grades obtained by each student, the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). SGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester. SGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester. CGPA is the weighted average of all the courses taken so far. For repeat courses, only the most recent grade points are used, even if they are less than the earlier attempts. The following points need to be noted: Repeat courses will be indicated on the transcript together with the repeat count. \"S\" or \"U\" is awarded for PhD Thesis work only and is not considered in CGPA calculation. Letter grades for BBA & BS programs Letter grades for MBA & MS programs Letter grades for PhD programs The Following grades are common for all degree programs: Grades CR, I and W are not used in computing SGPA or the CGPA. The admission will be cancelled automatically after completion of maximum duration allowed to earn a degree. A student can repeat a course if that course has not been passed or the student desires to improve his/her grade. A student must repeat all failed courses. Students under warning must repeat such passed courses, in which their GPA is less than the minimum CGPA required for their degree. For example, MS students under warning (CGPA less than 2.50) must repeat courses in which their GPA is less than 2.50 (i.e. C or C- grade). A student may request an extension in the final examination for genuine reasons subject to the following. FAST-House Rohtas Road, G-9/4 Islamabad - 44000\n",

The financial assistance is limited to tuition fees only and is discontinued if the student's CGPA falls below 2.00 for undergraduate degree and 2.5 for graduate degree. The repayment of loan starts three months after graduation or getting a job, whichever is earlier. The total amount has to be repaid within a period of four years after graduation. Students are required to sign to this effect. All those who are admitted and are in real need of financial assistance should apply on the prescribed Financial Aid form. A notice to this effect will be posted on the notice board. Merit scholarship is awarded to the Top THREE position holders of each Board. This scholarship is available for four years of un-interrupted studies with full course load and is equal to the full tuition fee. Continuation of merit scholarship is subject to maintaining semester GPA of 3.0 or higher. The university awards certificates to those undergraduate students, who are the top three in their department. Students are selected from each of the four years of every degree program. Only those students are eligible who have undertaken the prescribed course load and have SGPA of 3.00 or higher. This is offered on need-cum-merit to rural and urban students in both Undergraduate and Graduate level for all disciplines.

Good financial management is, therefore, vitally important to the economic health of business organizations. However, the constant shifts in economic conditions, intense competition for financial resources and questionable business practices have made financial management a complex and challenging undertaking. The BS Accounting & Finance program is designed to prepare students to meet the challenges posed by this complex but exciting area that has assumed much greater importance in the wake of the recent financial crisis in the world. This crisis has taught us that prudent financial management could mean the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful business enterprise. BS Accounting & Finance is tailored to first impart a broad-based education in the fundamentals of business and management and then develop the quantitative and analytical skills necessary to become prudent, astute and ethical financial managers.  There are a number of pathways to choose from including audit, taxation, budget analysis, financial accounting and management accounting.

The candidates are required to publish research papers in journals of international repute. PhD coursework comprises 6 courses (total 18 credit hours). A non-credit course “SS 310 Research Methodology” must also be passed; unless already passed during MS coursework. The student becomes eligible to appear in the Comprehensive Examination after passing the PhD coursework with a minimum CGPA of 3.0. This exam must be passed within two years of admission, failing which the admission shall be cancelled. The student can start work on PhD thesis only after The PhD Dissertation must contain original research work. The Plagiarism Test shall be conducted on the Dissertation before its submission to foreign experts. The PhD Dissertation shall be evaluated by at least two PhD experts from technologically/ academically advanced foreign countries. If the foreign evaluators recommend that the work is acceptable for award of PhD, then a local committee, comprising two local experts and an internal evaluator, is constituted. The thesis is sent to all three members of this committee. After receiving positive comments from the local experts, the student is expected to defend his/her work before this Committee. The student will be declared successful after the local Committee approves the work.

            "Text:  The PhD program provides high quality management education to business scholars i.e. to discover and impart culturally and globally relevant knowledge in management sciences. The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus. The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization:  Admission is based on a candidate’s performance in the following: The PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements. Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit) Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action. Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed. Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers. Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.
